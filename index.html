        <p id="loveText">I hear you and I understand your feelings. I get that it’s very difficult to move on from the past and I see how the
        past has eroded some of your trust in me. I understand just how difficult it is to trust someone again after so much has
        happened and I'm grateful that you’ve been trying your best. <br><br>
        
        I also recognise that words aren’t enough to fix everything which causes reassurances to feel empty. I’m glad we share
        the same belief that consistent actions over time is the true way to know if someone means what they say. I beg you to
        please give this precious time to us so that my actions will add some weight to my words. I am saying this because when
        we look at our relationship as a whole, time has always proved to be medicine: we have argued/fought less and less,
        understood each others’ boundaries better, and gotten a clear understanding of what we both need as this relationship
        has progressed. <br><br>

        Having said that I also acknowledge that these changes for the better mainly occurred because of the sacrifices you made to teach me what
        was right. I understand that this was unfair on your part as you should not have had to experience pain in order for me
        to grow. I am deeply sorry about this and I, too, wish that I knew better from the start. I promise that you will not ever need to teach me anymore and that I have the capability to think for myself. I hope you
        know that you and I see eye to eye on nearly everything and I agree with your assessments. I understand where you’re
        coming from all the time and I believe that we have mastered communicating calmly with one another. I am confident that
        in the future, we will be able to communicate as seamlessly as we are doing now and live without conflict. <br><br>
        
        What I want more than anything is to start fresh again. I don’t mean to forget the past, but to accept that it happened
        and take it one day at a time. I wish I could date you from the start all over again with the newfound knowledge I have.
        I can’t lose you; I know my heart can’t take it. Please, let's find another way other than ending things. Let’s act on
        that promise we made to each other that night before POP to start fresh. I can’t believe that in my teenage years, I’ve
        found a love for someone so great that I would give up my life for them and I just can’t lose it. Please, I really
        cannot lose you. You are the one I’ve always prayed for manifested in real life and the stars really aligned for us to
        meet. Even if it's blind faith, please give it to me, I promise I’ll prove it all to you. I promise I can make you happy
        and I promise I can help you grow Megan.
